# BorEngine
My OpenGL based Game Engine [C++]

Yep, I'm creating my own game engine!

It will be built on top of openGL using C++.

I'll leave it open source but mostly uncommented, keep that in mind if you want to check out the code: it will be messy!

Why "Bor Engine" you say?

Mainly because I was bored and wanted to create a 3D engine...soooo "Bor3D Engine"? ikr

I'll think later about a fitting acronym...
